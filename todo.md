# To-do

- [x] Brainstorm 40 ideas.
- [x] Jason plays Shopping Cart Hero, Learn 2 Fly.
- [x] Circle falls onto plane.
- [x] Circle moves across screen.
- [x] Tap to add force.
- [x] Circles slide off ramp, stop on ground.
- [x] See fuel meter deplete and disable force.
- [x] Force depletes with fuel.
- [x] Particle system displays exhaust.
- [x] Particles scale down with force.
- [x] See distance milestones.
- [x] Read:  Tap quickly to propel.
- [x] After stopped, read: distance.
- [x] Fuel object offsets center of mass.
- [x] Convert distance into coins.
- [x] Earn money for distance.
- [x] Upgrade fuel.
- [x] Upgrade body density and color.  Glass.  Aluminum.
- [x] Upgrade nose cone:  linear drag.
- [x] Upgrade fins:  cardboard has angular drag.
- [x] Place ground and sky to left.
- [x] Instructions to tap faster and upgrade.
